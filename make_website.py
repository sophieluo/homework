"""homework 5 submissions"""

"""You will submit the following 4 files:
1. make_website.py: the program you wrote
2. make_website_test.py [and other .txt files for testing]: the unit tests you wrote
for all your functions and if you created other .txt files (
e.g. different versions of your resume) to be read by your main program or your unit tests, 
please include those in the .zip file. 
Part of grading your assignment will be to run your unit tests. 
We want to make sure they pass if they reference other .txt files.
3. resume.txt: the text file you created to be read by your program
4. resume.html: the resume file that was generated when you ran your program

Please zip all 4 of these files and name the .zip file using your PennKey. 
For example, Brandonâ€™s submission would be lbrandon.zip. Please, no .rar files!"""
